Poppy Seed Quick Bread
======
Almond-y/vanilla-y non-lemon-y goodness


## Ingredients
* 3 cup flour
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 1/4 cup sugar 
* 1 1/8 cup cooking oil
* 1 1/2 cup milk
* 3 eggs
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla (I use 2 tsp)
* 1 1/2 tsp butter flavoring
* 1 1/2 tsp almond flavoring
* 1 1/2 Tbs poppy seed

## Tools
* 2 loaf pans
* Mixing bowl
* Spatula
* Toothpicks
* Hand mixer

## Steps
1. Mix ingredients for 1-2 minutes
2. Grease & flour the loaf pans
3. Pour into loaf pans
4. Bake for 1 hour @ 350 deg F

## Additional Notes
* Top will crack
* You may also need to place foil around the edges towards the end of baking as the edge tends to over-brown before the middle bakes through
* The bread is done when an inserted toothpick comes out clean 
* I start watching it after about 45 minutes (depending on your oven and how evenly you divide the batter between the two loaf pans)
